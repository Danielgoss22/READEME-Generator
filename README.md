# README-Generator

## Description

-I wanted to create a README generator so that I will be able to quickly and efficiently create README's for futur use.

-I realized while working through this that I am able to create multiple JS files and functions to call on in order to make my code easier to read and debug.

-I am grateful to the tutor I used, Juan Delgado, because he was helpful in getting me to realize that I was overthinking my code and making the entire process mush more difficult than it should be.
